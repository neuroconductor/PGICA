## Introduction

ICA (independent components analysis) algorithms are a collection of
statistical decompositions used for blind source separation. Our procedure
uses the procedures developed by Eloyan [@eloyan2013likelihood, @eloyan2013semiparametric]. ICA has become a standard tool in functional
neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging. This package was built with
that use in mind. However, it can be used generally.
